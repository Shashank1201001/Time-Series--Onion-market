Onion Market Time Series Prediction
This repository contains a time series prediction model for the onion market in Mumbai. The model utilizes the SARIMAX algorithm, which has shown excellent performance in forecasting onion prices.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of historical onion market data, including the date variable and the Modal Price (Pricemod) of onions in Mumbai. The dataset covers a significant period, providing enough data points for accurate analysis and prediction.

Model Building
Two models were developed: Holt Winter and SARIMAX. After careful evaluation, the SARIMAX model demonstrated superior performance, achieving the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value of 410.

Conclusion
By leveraging the SARIMAX model, this project aims to provide accurate predictions for onion prices in Mumbai's market. Users can refer to the provided notebooks for a detailed understanding of the data preprocessing, model training, and prediction steps. The model's robust performance, as indicated by the low RMSE value, ensures reliable insights for stakeholders in the onion market.
